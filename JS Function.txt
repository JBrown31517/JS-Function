Write a complete webpage with HTML and embedded JavaScript. The JavaScript code is made of 3
functions with following function prototypes.

display(3 parameters) { … } // No return, called by primary script, call other two 
                            // functions and print their return values.
max(3 parameters) { … } // Return the maximum of 3 parameters to caller
avg(3 parameters) { … } // Return the average of 3 parameters to caller

The primary script of this web page first reads 3 numbers from the user with proper prompt, using
the prompt() function. Then it calls the display() function with three input numbers as parameters.

Note:
• The input should be done only inside the primary script. Otherwise, 5 points deduction will
be applied.
• For implementation of user-defined functions, no library functions, like Math.max() or
Math.min(), can be used. Must use basic JavaScript statements to implement these functions.
Otherwise, 5 points deduction will be applied for each occurrence.
• No late submission will be accepted.
• The webpage must run in regular browsers without error.
